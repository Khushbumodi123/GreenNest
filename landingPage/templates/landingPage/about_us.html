The platform will centralise a variety of green products, from biodegradable kitchenware to organic cleaning supplies, enabling consumers to make environmentally conscious decisions easily. Utilising a tech stack comprising Python and Django for backend operations, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive front-end, and Django's default SQLite for development, scalable to PostgreSQL as needed.
